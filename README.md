# Extreme Weather Events Prediction
Use public data to predict the probability of extreme weather events based on temperature patterns and carbon emissions.

## Problem Definition
The US experiences about 12 hurricanes per year out of which usually 3 are major hurricanes. The results of such extreme weather events are loss of life as well as enormous damage to property. The purpose of this project is to inform the public on the factual dimensions of extreme weather events as well as to investigate methods of forecasting of these events.

## Domain Background
During the hyperactive period between 1400 BC and 1000 AD the probability of a severe hurricane hitting the coast of the Gulf of Mexico was 3 to 5 times higher than the so called 'quiescent' perdiod of the next millenium. The quiescent periods are hypothesized to be caused by a south-westerly placement of the Azores high. However, as of 1980, a departure from the stable trend has been observed in the North Atlantic. That is, namely, the increasing in number of hurricanes as well as the increasing in intensity of these hurricanes.


## Datasets
### NOAA IBTrACS Hurricane Dataset
The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) is a collaboration between several regional specialized meteorological centers with the purpose of creating a centralized database of tropical storms for public use. Another goal of the program is to provide an open access to storm data in order to elicit useful feedback from the public.

The dataset contains (at the time of writing) 694 061 rows of data. The data represents periodical observations of the location and intensity of tropical storms since 1842.

### NOAA GHCN Temperature Dataset

The first instance of satellite surveilance of hurricanes was in [1966](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-168/section1.htm#:~:text=Since%20February%201965%2C%20meteorological%20satellites,%2C%20hurricane%2C%20and%20typhoon.%22), so we will consider at sea data after this year as reliable. However, we will also investigate the full historic records of hurricane landfalls, which we will consider reliable for obvious reasons.
